OVERVIEW
========

This is just a bunch of trial code I'm using to hack at while I learn the Go 
Programming Language.  As such it's going to be a Poor Go MUD (PoGoMud) at best
but I hope this will end up being a fun learning experience for me and provide
some examples for others that come after me.

If this ever gets good enough I will likely move it to it's own repository and 
make a go of it but for now it remains an experiment.

GoLang Resources
================

The major Golang resoruces were obviously of big help.  They'll be of help to 
you too.

* GoLang.org - http://golang.org/
* GoLang-Nuts Google Group - https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/golang-nuts

Credits & User Examples
=======================

As a learning experience I'm pulling a lot of this code from examples I'm 
finding in many places.  Since I modify it greatly, join it with other examples
and so forth it will be difficul to credit every line explicitly so I want
to gather some links I pulled examples from and either uses code from or
I found to be specifically useful.
